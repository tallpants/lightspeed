# TODO

* ~~Some history items have a URL but not a title. What's causing this? Do we need a different way to display these items? Or can we come up with a universal way that works for both history items with and without titles.~~

* ~~History search is still messed up.~~

* Hitting enter should open the topmost item, whether it's a tab, bookmark, or history item.

* Separate the styles into their own stylus file and import them into the list components instead of dumping everything in the app component.
